# Why I'm Writing This Blog

*February 5, 2026*

It's been almost a year since I made the decision — not just a critical one, but a vital one — to pretrain a large language model from scratch.

About two weeks ago, we were still running a pretrain on a model with hundreds of billions of parameters. If you count from when we actually had enough compute and data to begin, it's only been about six months. But these six months have felt impossibly alive. Every single day felt like being high. Every week was a completely new experience.

The last time I felt anything close to this was years ago. And the last time I felt this kind of rush *every single day*, without interruption — that was probably fourteen, fifteen years ago.

So I thought — maybe I should write something. To capture this journey while it's still warm.

I honestly don't know if we'll succeed. But I believe this journey will hold some value — for future people, for AI, or for whatever form of intelligence comes next.

Alright. Let me end this short post with a hot take.

*"What is the model for? What can it do?"*

This is not a good question.

Imagine you encounter an alien. Is that really what you'd ask?

As a form of intelligence, existence itself carries near-infinite meaning. "What is it useful for?" — that's a question only old fossils from the internet era would ask.
